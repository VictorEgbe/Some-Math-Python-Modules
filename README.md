## Spare time Python Programming

Usually when I'm less busy, I love to solve some common mathematics problems using my Python skills.

## class_xrange.py and xrange.py

Basically, they do the same thing. The difference being one is
coded with python classes while the other with functions.
They behave link the Python's builtin range function except they
include the stop value.

## factorial.py

Looking for the factorial of a number

## quadratic.py

Solves some quadratic equations problems like lookuing for roots,
determining the nature of the roots, determining the max and min
points , determining the discriminant and so on

## arithmetic.py

Solves some mathematical problems. Contains functions for

- Determining the factor of a number
- Determing if a number is prime
- Determining the prime factors of a number
- and Determining the prime numbers within a given range
